One tends to believe that others' actions or how others feel are directly related to them, because of some action of theirs. They take almost everything personally and blame themselves for every setback and problem.
<br>
<br>"It's all my fault" is a statement that one can hear from people who are in this thinking trap. Personalizing results in guilt and disappointment in oneself about being the sole cause of anything negative. Individuals experience a great deal of sadness when they fall in this trap of thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>Like other cognitive distortions, the first step is to identify them when you engage in your thoughts. Notice your thought process and then seek evidence. Use data from real life to tell yourself why your thought isn't true. A sentence starter can be "That's not true because..." and describe these alternate thoughts in vivid details.
</div><div>
</div><div>Reattribution is a way to identify factors that are outside of self and may be related to the event. This does not mean that one deflects self of any responsibility. Carefully evaluate situations to really determine whether or not you have any responsibility for the outcome. Don’t place unnecessary blame on yourself for the actions and responsibilities of others. Understand the need to work on factors that you are under control.
</div><div>
</div><div>Alternatively, have self talk that is caring, that is, have a single standard for evaluating yourself and others. Most often, we are harsher on ourselves than others. Encourage yourself the same way you would encourage others. And give yourself the permission to make errors.
</div><div>Your mental health matters. Reach out and seek help.

Any instance is seen as the doing of someone else, devaluing one's own role on the situation. Why is this a problem?
<br>
<br>Believing a person's emotions are a result of someone else's doing, makes them feel like they have no control over the situation or themselves. They feel helpless and often feel like victims in most situations. That is one possibility, while on the other hand it can lead to anger or aggression against the one who they feel is in control.
<br>
<br>Blaming can put a strain on relationships as well. One blames the other while the other becomes the victim. This can be dangerous for the relationship.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>How can this be worked on?</strong>
<div>
</div><div>Examine your own life and see whether you tend to put the onus of a situation exclusively on others in most cases, minimizing your own role. If that is the case, next try to look at situations objectively. See who is involved and what roles they seem to play. Maybe take the help of a person you trust while doing so. Understand what role you yourself play. How much control do you feel you have. If the same thought comes in and you have thoughts like "I have no part in this, this is all because of person X" challenge that thought. This can be done by asking "Do I really have no part to play? Is there something I can do?"
</div><div>This will give you a sense of control and a feeling that you are not helpless, that there may be something you can do to better your situation.
</div><div>This can reduce the emotional turmoil that the anger or helplessness may cause as well.
</div><div>This is not to say that everything is one's own fault because that can cause further problems. But rather to understand that while one engages in blaming, knowing they have some level of control can help them take ownership of the situation and take steps to work on it accordingly.</div></div>

                            <p class="mbr-text mb-0 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Catastrophizing </strong>is the thinking trap where one ruminates on the same thought over and over again and imagines the worst case scenario, without taking any proactive action. The triggers may be ambiguous situations/message, a situation that you fear, situation where something of value is at stake, or simply when you're depleted of your energy. One may catastrophize in different ways-
<br>Downward spiral- from one trigger event, one thinks of possible cases which are progressively worse and creates increasing amounts of anxiety, like a spiral going downward.
<br>Scatter shot- based on a trigger event, one thinks that different negative events will take place even though they may be unassociated. This increases anxiety and results in inability to focus.
<br>Circling- here, an individual goes around the same primary theme over and over again; for example, Ms A got a call for submitting a report the next day; Ms A thinks, "I have no time, I'm surely going to lose this job." This thought goes around in circles, and she takes no action, instead procrastinates.&nbsp;</p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>How to deal with these catastrophizing thoughts?
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div>Firstly, it is important to identify them and challenge them.
</div><div>To challenge these thoughts, identify the worst case scenarios. Get them all out of your head and write them down. Next, think about the best case. Describe it as elaborately as the worst case. Now, think about the probable outcome, which may not be the best, but definitely better than the worst case. Once you have your probable outcomes, list down the action that you can take for each of these outcomes. This way, you plan for the different outcomes that are possible.
</div><div>Challenging the thoughts by identifying purposeful action for each of the probable outcomes helps in a person find meaning
</div><div>Another way to deal with the associated anxiety is deliberate breathing. Consciously take in the air and expand your stomach like a balloon, and slowly release it completely by contracting your stomach. This allows you to focus on your breathing and manage your anxiety to some extent.
