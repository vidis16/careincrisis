                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Graduating students are facing a point of uncertainty in life. Whether this is at the school level or college level, it has left students with a sense of fear about the future, their future. Being unsure as to how all this will pan out clubbed with the fear of what one will do once it finally does come to an end is a scary prospect. The plans one had about what they would do seem to be falling apart as each day goes by.<div><br></div><div>Since the pandemic really hit us all at the end of the academic year, a lot of things have been indefinitely postponed or put on hold. Like for instance educational opportunities or career building steps that one would have taken at this time cannot or have not been done, due to the lockdown. In some cases exams have not been completed, or graduations have not happened, and a lot of other things like that. With alternate measures and steps being taken by educational institutions to try to complete the required assessments, it has further put pressure on the students. They have to go through worry about the pandemic, the fear of themselves or family members contracting the illness, worry about the future and how it would look for all of us and finally these academic pressures as well.</div><div><br></div><div>These are not easy thoughts and feelings for one to handle. What are some things that you can do in order to handle them?</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Accept the uncertainty</strong>. It is important to keep in mind that, it is okay to not have the solutions to all these doubts. This is an unprecedented situation that we all are in, and it is natural to feel the way you do. There is no rulebook that dictates or spells out how one can handle a situation like this. By accepting the uncertainty, that gives it less power over you. It would not control you as much as it did in the past.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>All of us are in this together</strong>. There are probably countless students everywhere who are facing similar situations as yourself. You are not alone. It may seem like only you have such worries, that is not the case. A lot of us have these thoughts and it is not easy.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Talk to someone</strong>. Talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling aand express your concerns to them. Just saying it out loud can give you some relief. You can discuss and come up with options as to what you can do and how they can help you through this.</div><div>If this seems difficult to do, you can write it down for yourself. Getting it out of your system is the main idea. Seeing it in black and white like that, can reduce its impact over you.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Utilize the time you have</strong>. This pandemic has given us an opportunity of sorts. We have a lot of time and not much to do. A lot of us are even getting bored. In quarantine, we can all make use of time to maybe do some courses, expand our knowledge and keep ourselves prepared. There are online courses in almost every area, provided by some of the top universities at minimal rates or even at no charge in some cases. Doing something that engages you, while educating yourself can help reduce the helplessness you feel at a time like this.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Try not to isolate yourself</strong>. These are difficult times and we all have a lot on our minds. Isolation would only help these thoughts grow. Try to be around people who care about you (while maintaining social distancing). Whether it is your family or your friends, whether you do it virtually or within the walls of your house, try to connect to someone. Be in touch with someone and check in with them if you can. You might even find that they have similar concerns like your own.</div><div><br></div><div>Be kind to yourself, take care of yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Your mental health matters.</div></h3>
