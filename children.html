                    Managing Children During Quarantine</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">Children are at home throughout the day due to schools being shut. This can be a very stressful situation for parents. Parents often struggle with managing their own schedules along with their child's on normal days. But when the reprieve that school provides is not there now it can be even more difficult. Along with this having to juggle their worries and their own jobs, can be a lot for parents. Here we give some pointers and suggestions for parents on how to manage children during the quarantine period.</h3>

<br>
<br>- Find things you can do together with your children. For example you could play games, learn something new like baking or start gardening.
<br>- Have family time together. Now that there is a lot of time and everyone is at home, you can take advantage of this and use this time to bond with your child and come together as a family. This can be done by eating meals together, by watching a movie or even playing a board game. It gives you a way to connect with the children and spend some quality time with them.
<br>- Do not critique yourself for how you are with your child. Meaning, do not be too hard on yourself as a parent as this can be a stressful time for you as well.
<br>- Allow yourself to take frequent breaks, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed.
<br>-No two children are similar, the same way no two parents are similar. What works for one parent may not work for all. Find what strategies work for you and make use of that.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Here are some pointers for children 
<div>
</div><div>Children may be confused about what is going on now. Educate children on the importance of social isolation and how it helps the community. These issues can be scary for children therefore it is important to use terms they can understand and relate to. This can ease some of their fears and they would feel supported and reassured. 
</div><div>Help them understand that this is not a vacation, and that and that they are doing this to help themselves and others. 
</div><div>Make sure the child has a routine or time table in place that they can follow. This helps structure their learning and helps you plan ahead. 
</div><div>Help them develop a hobby. This can be something like reading, origami making, playing an instrument etc 
</div><div>Many online resources are available for children to help them learn and explore concepts.There are books, videos, dance classes, language classes, academic classes etc available online. 
</div><div>Children may feel lonely being inside and not being able to see their friends. Help them feel connected to their friends through video calls. 
</div><div>Staying healthy! Children would want to be free and be on their devices all day. Therefore building healthy practices is essential. This includes diet, exercise, sleep and most importantly hygiene. These can be things you work on together, as a family! 
</div><div>Engage them in the day to day workings of the household. Giving them small jobs (based on their age) around the house can help them learn about what it takes to maintain a house and about being responsible for things. They can learn, for example how to fold their clothes or how to make a grocery list. 
</div><div>Monotony can be difficult for children to handle. So it is important to keep things interesting by introducing some variety or something out of the ordinary to do. 
</div><div>Start a project. To build on their creativity, you can help your child start a project. They can use arts, crafts or whatever else interests them to do so. Example a puzzle, knitting, painting etc This will keep them engaged in something they like and help them think outside the box.</div><div><br></div><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>Help your child. Help yourself.&nbsp;</div></div>
